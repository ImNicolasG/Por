        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently enrolled at Mott Community College for my associates degree 
            in computer information systems. I have an interest in programming and computers 
            as a whole so my goal is to make it a career.
        </p>
        <h2>Work History</h2>
        <p>
            I began working in highschool with my dad who was a contractor. We did work 
            on foreclosed properties, making sure they were up-kept and ready to be sold. 
            From there, I decided to join the Marine Corps, however I was injured and it caused 
            me to be separated after only a year in service. When I got home, I started looking for 
            work and accepted the first offer that came my way so that I could get started on my 
            life with my family. I have since bounced between a couple of jobs due to my injuries from 
            the military, but found myself with the opportunity to pursue school for a passion of mine. 
            This leads me to where I am now, building websites, and diving
